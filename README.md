# Primes with a Prime Number of Digits Containing a Given String of Digits

On 8 April 2021, I gave a talk on [this blog post](http://www.mathemafrica.org/?p=12942) for the Stellenbosch University Mathematics Society. The talk is [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0BXqDGp1pc).

There is a [companion project](https://www.github.com/dlnnlsn/prime-strings) to this one which implements the Bailie-PSW primality test in JavaScript. This allows for the creation of a web page where one can enter a desired number of digits and a string of digits, and primes of the given length containing the given string of digits will be found and displayed to the user.

This talk followed one given by Lourens van Niekerk on 1 April 2021 which provided an introduction to the Prime Number Theorem, and an outline of the proof of the theorem. This is available on the Stellenbosch University Mathematics Society's YouTube channel: [It's Prime Time!: Exploring the Prime Number Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1asrICySfM).
